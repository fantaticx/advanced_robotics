 * @brief Edge defining the cost function for limiting the translational and rotational velocity.

 * The edge depends on three vertices \f$ \mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{s}_{ip1}, \Delta T_i \f$ and minimizes: \n
 * \f$ \min \textrm{penaltyInterval}( [v,omega]^T ) \cdot weight \f$. \n
 * \e v is calculated using the difference quotient and the position parts of both poses. \n
 * \e omega is calculated using the difference quotient of both yaw angles followed by a normalization to [-pi, pi]. \n
 * \e weight can be set using setInformation(). \n
 * \e penaltyInterval denotes the penalty function, see penaltyBoundToInterval(). \n
 * The dimension of the error / cost vector is 2: the first component represents the translational velocity and
 * the second one the rotational velocity.
